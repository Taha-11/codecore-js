html


# Review: Basic CSS Selectors

```
*
tagName
.class
#id
ancestor descendant

And any combinations






## CSS Selectors Quiz:

What does each of the following selectors do?

- img
- img.large
- #reset-button
- ul#homework li
- img, a
- #reset-button, #publish-button
- #reset-button, form img.large






# Selectors

See: http://overapi.com/jquery/

```js
$('div.big')
```

Selects all elements that match "css selector"

Example:

```js
// Go to Amazon.com and type:
$('img')

// Now, hover over the returned value in the console to highlight that element on the page.

// Now type:
$('img').length
```

What does `.length` return?
